			<h2><b>Recommended LED Protocol</b></h2>
			<p>The recommended professional LED protocol is six treatments a week or two apart, followed by a maintenance treatment every month or twoo red light LED and it works, giving you plumper, firmer skin and a more youthful look. Professional LED treatments can also help boost your mood during long, dark winters.</p>

			<p>LED treatments are painless, cool and relaxing, and unlike IPL or laser treatments, carry no risk of burning. An IPL treatment delivers a bright blast of light at very high energy levels through a hand-held device, and can be uncomfortable, even painful.

			<h2><b>LED Is Gentle and Soothing</b> </h2>
			<p>Unlike IPL, LED treatments don't generate any heat. They're even relaxing. Your eyes can't be hurt by LED so don't have to be covered.  LED treatments are a good choice for people who want to boost collagen or treat acne. Home LED treatments and equipment will not deliver the same results because the equipment is not as powerful.</p>
